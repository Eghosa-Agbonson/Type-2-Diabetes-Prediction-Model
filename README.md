I have been tasked with developing a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient developing type 2 diabetes. This model will leverage key health and lifestyle indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, age, glucose levels, insulin levels, and family history. The goal is to support early diagnosis and provide actionable recommendations for personalized lifestyle or dietary interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing long-term healthcare costs.
